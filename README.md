# Giphy
### PennLPS Bootcamp Week #6 Assignment

This assignment is to make a dynamic web application that populates with gifs of your choice. 

Your app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.

When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images and append them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

The user can also input values to search for their own gifs, which will then be added to the current array.
